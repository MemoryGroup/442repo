# 442repo
This goal of this project is to create an andriod app that people can use to memorize and test how well they remember character to integer maps of various sizes, from size 2 to size 26.
An example of a map of size 6 would be:
  A-1   B-2   C-3   D-4   E-5   F-6
An example of map of 26 would be:
  A-9   B-3   C-5   D-2   E-6   F-9   G-0   H-2   I-7   J-8   K-1   L-4   M-0
  N-8   O-2   P-7   Q-5   R-9   S-0   T-4   U-6   V-7   W-1   X-3   Y-8   Z-4
We plan to include reminders and progress metrics to help the user remember the map and show them how well they remember the map over time.
Also, we plan to expand the content outside of just the character to integer maps, and allow users to input their own maps of things like word to definition pairs.
