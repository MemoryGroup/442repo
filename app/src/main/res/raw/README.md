**Our group is also looking for some design work to be done. We are in need of:**

*A new, more creative launcher icon for our app. The current one is shown here:*
https://github.com/MemoryGroup/442repo/blob/voice-submissions/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/memory_project_icon.png

This icon should be small, about 48x48 pixels.
Please submit a png file, and upload any submissions for the launcher icon to the memory3_content slack channel.
These are uploaded into the 442repo/app/src/main/res/mipmap folder.

*A new, unique background image for our main menu. The current one is shown here:*
https://github.com/MemoryGroup/442repo/blob/voice-submissions/app/src/main/res/drawable/flashcardimage.png

Please submit a png file, and upload any submissions for the launcher icon to the memory3_content slack channel.

*Two vector files: a check mark and an X to mark answers right and wrong*

These check mark should be green and the X should be red.
Please upload these as two separate svg or psd files, uploaded to the memory3_content slack page.
These are uploaded into the 442repo/app/src/main/res/drawable folder.

**Also, thanks to all who have participated in beta testing for our app!**
