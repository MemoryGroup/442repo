###For content creation:

**If you would like to submit a recording of your voice for our project, here are the requirements:**

-You must have numbers 0 through 9 recorded as separate mp3 files and named as shown below:
  ```
  zero.mp3
  one.mp3
  ...
  eight.mp3
  nine.mp3
  ```
  
-You must have all 26 letters recorded as separate mp3 files and named as shown below:
  ```
  A.mp3
  B.mp3
  ...
  Y.mp3
  Z.mp3
  ```

-Your submission of mp3 files must be contained within two separate directories, one for numbers and one for letters, so as to keep all of the submissions separate, which will allow us to incorporate them into our project much easier. Please make sure your directory name has not been taken before adding it, we don't want anyones submissions overwritten.
  ```
  numbers1
  letters1
  numbers2
  letters2
  ```

**Thank You!**
